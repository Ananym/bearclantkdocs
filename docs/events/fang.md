Our ancestors would often turn to ritual tokens to settle disputes, commune with nature, or simply to entertain themselves.  Greatest among these tokens was the Bear Fang - assured to bring ruin to all who'd oppose its bearer!

Bear Fang is a simple yet savage bluffing game.
Rules explained at the door, but included below.

500k per game - catch us in Bear Falls, half way between Kugnae's north gate and the arena.

---------

Players start with three flower cards and one fang card.
To begin, everyone plays a card face down.
The first player may then either play another card, or make a bid.  Play continues in turns until someone makes a bid.

To make a bid, a player announces the number of cards they think they can turn over safely.  The next player may raise or pass, and once everyone passes, the highest bidder must take the challenge.

That player must inspect the number of cards they bid - starting with all of their own, then those from the top of other players' stacks.  You always inspect from the top, but can rotate between players' stacks in any order.

If they only find harmless flowers, they score a point!
If they encounter a Fang, however, they'll permanently lose a card from their hand - picked blindly by the fang's owner.  

The scorer (or the fang owner) starts the next round.  First player to two points takes the game!
