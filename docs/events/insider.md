-----

One of the players acts as Master, answering the Yes/No questions of the crowd.  Host provides the object being investigated.  Among the crowd, there may be an insider who knows the right answer.  The insider will be trying to guide the crowd to the answer, without giving away their identity.

If a time limit is reached without the answer being found, everyone loses!

If the crowd identifies the right answer, everyone (including the master) attempts to discern the insider - first by voting to accuse the correct guesser, then by modal fingerpointing.  If you believe that there was no insider, point at the host for their cunning trick!

If the crowd identifies the insider (or determines there was no insider), the crowd wins and splits the pot.  If they get it wrong, the insider takes it all!
