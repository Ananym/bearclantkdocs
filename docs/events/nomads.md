When a community falls into disarray, it takes a true leader to reforge a family.  Whether driven apart by natural disaster or lost to the annals of history, it takes the right individual to step up and restore unity.

Bear Nomads is a simple 1v1 strategy game played on a small grid.  Each player manages six pieces, moving one per turn.  The pieces may move any distance in any of eight directions, but cannot move through or 'take' one another.  Players vie to be the first to regroup their nomads by connecting four pieces in an adjacent line.

Play will proceed in a tournament format, including a loser's bracket.  We have room in the falls to play a few games at a time, and each game doesn't take too long. 

1st: 250k
2nd: 150k
Loser's bracket: 100k

Catch us in Bear Falls at 7pm EST Weds 6th, half way between Kugnae's north gate and the arena!
