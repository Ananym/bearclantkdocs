Life is harsh for the Bears of the Vale, and harsher still while brainwashed minions of Deathwish lurk in their midst.    

Bear Renegade is a social deduction game where players work as a team to scavenge enough to eat without losing their stockpiles to the hidden renegades.  

     Rules explained at the time, 
      but are included below for reference. 
 
     Prize pool: 600k 
      Catch us at 6:45pm EST, Thurs 26th in the Bear cave - 
      between Kugnae's north gate and the arena!

--------- 

The Vale Bears forage for food to survive the supernatural cold. 
Some players are brainwashed minions of Deathwish, unknown to the others. 

Each turn plays as follows - 

 * The leader proposes a team and all players vote on it.  

* If successful, the team goes foraging -  
  any renegades on the team may secretly sabotage the trip. 
   After the trip, the next turn begins with a new leader. 
 
* If the vote is unsuccessful, the next turn begins  
  immediately with a new leader.

If 3 hunts succeed, the bears win.  If 3 hunts fail, Deathwish's  minions win.  For each hunt, the number of bears on the team will change depending on number of players. 

If the vote fails 5 times in a row, the family falls into disarray and Deathwish instantly wins.
