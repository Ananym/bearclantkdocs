<b>                   ~* Final hour Feast *~

                 As part of the Yudu festival,
              in the Palace of Kugnae at 10pm EST.

          The hour is late, and the festivalgoers are
          crying out for their traditional meal of
          celebratory soup.  However, the scrap of paper
          bearing Girl's hierloom recipe has been sneakily
          claimed by a passing goat!  Can you help her
          piece it back together?

          This is an open-ended scavenger hunt.
          Players will have the purpose of the soup
          explained to them on the day, and will be
          permitted ten minutes to roam the
          kingdoms to snatch up any ingredients
          that look appropriate.  Employ your senses
          and forage out the finest ingredients!

          Upon your return (don't be late!), you will
          need to pitch your recipe to our panel of
          taste testers!  Explain to us the reasoning
          behind each of your choices, with points
          awarded for sensational imagery, creative
          choices, and relation to theme!

          Come out on top and Girl will whip up a
          festival-sized pot of your broth to feed
          the protesting partygoers!

<b>         Prizes:



   First  place: 200k, 5 BSSS points!
   Second place: 100k, 3 BSSS points! 
   Third  place:  50k, 3 BSSS points!
    All players:   At least 1 point for playing!

          Join the festivities at 10pm EST,
          in the Kugnae Palace!
