# Bearfall

This game is Spyfall.  Rules available online.
Simple, but gotta work out how to stop people asking cheesy questions.
Try e.g. just letting people refuse to answer if they don't like the question.

Uhh, maybe go ahead and change the name.  Imposter, or something.  Normals aren't going to recognise the name.

            6pm EST, Sun 28th
             Bear Clan Cave

     A bear's skills in espionage are unknown to most,
     so when a troupe of bear spies infiltrated human
     communities, nobody was any the wiser.

     There was only one problem: behind their perfect
     disguises, the bears can't see out - they have
     no idea where they are!

     This fast-moving social deduction game is held
     over multiple rounds as the human players try to
     uncover the Bear in their midst without giving
     away vital information.
    
     500k per round. 
     Catch us at 6pm EST, Sun 28th in the Bear Clan cave -
     half way between Kugnae's North gate and the Arena!
