# Of Bears and Warriors

The symbolic relationship between bears and warriors may be obvious at first glance, but for the Bear family this significance runs deeper.

The fury of the brown bear may be one of nature's deadliest and most unstoppable forces – but these great creatures were typically not quick to anger.  The ancient societies that lived alongside these creatures did not treat them as monsters, despite their threat.  Rather, it was understood that conflict may be avoided if the bears, their cubs, and their territory were treated with appropriate respect.  That their monumental strength was not used with abandon was considered emblematic of the way a warrior ought to conduct themselves.

Naturally, warriors of these societies modelled themselves after the bears they lived alongside.  The warriors of these bear cults were rightly feared, for when pushed their retaliation would be unstoppable.  They would partake of natural medicines - much of which learned from the bears themselves – and so induce in themselves a battle frenzy.  In this state, these 'bearserkers' could not be stopped by even the harshest of blows, and their attacks fell with the force of ten men.  They would take on the aspect of animals, howling and roaring, and as this wild trance left them they would find themselves weakened and tame.

While warriors of the modern era may use a combination of magic, meditation, or the borrowed strength of the totems to achieve similar results, the Bear family has never forgotten the roots of this practice.  The warrior of Bear is judicious with their strength, and uses their training as an opportunity to celebrate their ancestral ties to the land.
