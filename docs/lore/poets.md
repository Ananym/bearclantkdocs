# Of Bears and Poets

 
The affinity of the Bear and the Warrior is an understanding that comes easily to the eyes of many.  However, the ancient roots of our modern healing arts are lesser known in this age.
 
Ancient healers depended greatly on the bounties of the land, using herbs, roots, and other natural ingredients to make up the medicines and salves to treat their families.  The bears were heralded by the first healers as the wellspring of natural knowledge when it came to foraging - their inherent connection to the land allowing them to unearth an incredible variety of natural produce that the human foragers would later imitate.
 
Beyond just foraging for sustenance, bears were seen to seek out certain kinds of plants when faced with certain ailments, and to use macerated pastes of pungent roots rubbed into their fur to repel insects and soothe wounds.  This demonstration of natural lore made the bear a prominent symbol of the healer's craft among the animal kingdom.
 
As men began to delve into the realms of the spirit, the role of healers diversified.  Herbs and roots are of only so much utility against a spiritual malady.  Early shaman, armed with ritual and psychoactive components, would interact with the spirit realm to ward off unseen threats and expel entities causing disease.  
 
These shaman would call upon the natural spirits of the animal kingdom, treated with reverence by their families, for the strength to fulfil their role.  The shaman of families who revered the bears were widely regarded as the most powerful healers when it came to confrontation with the unknown - the might of the bear spirit was unparalleled, and the drive of the mother bear to protect her family bestowed the unerring force of will needed for the shaman to maintain their resolve.
 
While magic has become the medium of choice for today's healing arts, their roots are not lost to us.  Bear's poets draw upon the intuitive connection to our ancestral land to channel their restorative power, and embody the bear's unwavering strength and passion when ensuring the safety of their friends and family.  Our heritage of healing lore fosters the development of wise and powerful poets, familiar with the reciprocal coordination involved in fighting alongside the greatest warriors.
